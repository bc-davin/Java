Overview: In the Graphical User Interface (GUI) Lab we will construct a simple GUI step by step.

Data Manager: (Provided to the student) It is good programming practice to separate functionality into distinct classes.  
To accomplish this, GUI functionality is kept separate from the management of the application. 
The DataManager does not interact with the user.  
Rather, the GUI collects any user input like mouse-clicks and calls methods of the DataManager, and the 
DataManager reports results to the GUI which may be displayed to the user.  
Within the DataManager, there are usually one or more Data Structures, which are populated with one or more types of Data Elements. 
This DataManager has only simple functionality which does not require data structures other than simple fields.
