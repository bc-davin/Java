In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way 
that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot. 
In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted 
using an encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating ciphertext that can be read only if decrypted. 

The Enigma machines were a family of portable cipher machines with rotor scramblers that 
became Nazi Germany's principal crypto-system. It was broken by the Polish General Staff's
Cipher Bureau in December 1932, with the aid of French-supplied intelligence material obtained from a German spy.
