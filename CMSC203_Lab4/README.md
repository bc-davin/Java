Writing methods that take multi-dimensional arrays as parameters and/or return multi-dimensional arrays is similar to working with single-dimensional arrays. 
 The syntax for a method that accepts a two-dimensional array as a parameter is as follows:
returnType methodName( arrayType[][] arrayParameterName )
The syntax for a method that returns a two-dimensional array is the following:
returnArrayType [][] methodName( arrayType [ ][ ] arrayParameterName )
In this Lab, you will work with a 4-row, 20-column, two-dimensional array of integers. You will write methods that perform the following operations:
    1. Fill the 2-D array with random numbers between 50 and 80.
    2. Print the array.
    3. Set every array element of a given row to a specified value. The value is a parameter of a method.
    4. Find the minimum value in a given column of the array. The column is a parameter of a method.
    5. Count the number of elements of the array having a specified value. The value is a parameter of a method
To visualize how the two-dimensional array is working, your result will animate a bar graph. The  
Code for the bar graph is provided to you as BarChart.java. So, the framework for this lab will animate your algorithm, which will support you in checking the accuracy of your Java program.
